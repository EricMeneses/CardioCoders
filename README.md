Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. In order to identify which individuals are at the highest risk, a machine learning application is developed to identify the best predictors of disease to inform physician practice. This application aims to address the following:
- What are the most accurate predictors of cardiovascular disease?
- What locations in the United States are associated with higher relative quantities of the leading predictors?
